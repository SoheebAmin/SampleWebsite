# A Pracitcal Guide to Make Websites

This project was made first and foremost to help myself practice creating all the elements of a dynamic website. The files in this folder create a sample website with the sole purpose of highlighting different features of HTML, CSS, Javascript.

## Organization

If it isn't clear already, the root folder has the HTML pages, with the CSS, JS, and other files having their own folders.

## Some Things to Note

The index page has the most explanation of tags and elements, with unique features of other pages explained on that page.

The website relies on CSS from Bootstrap and W3 Schools, with their stylesheets included on the pages they are used. There are also local stylesheets, which the CSS of may be from antother website (mentioned in a comment on top) or it may be a self-made class to apply to select elements as needed.
