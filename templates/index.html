            <p>This homepage has 4 main components:</p>
            <ul>The Nav bar: Basic nav bar styled by W3 schools. The actual HTML resides within application.py, factored out to be the same for all pages.</ul>
            <ul>The video background: This is stock footage of waves added as a video play on loop. It styled to be full screen, with additional CSS to handle scaling.</ul>
            <ul>The page text: This is basic HTML text with some CSS styling.</ul>
            <ul>This explanation pop-up: This is a button and modal provided by bootstrap, with a bit of customization for button position and color with my own CSS.</ul>
            <p>As with most pages on this sample site, the stylesheets are from libararies, with a self-made stylesheet to customize provided styles as desired.
               Besides just viewing it in your browser, the source code for this page can be found <a style="color:blue" href="https://github.com/SoheebAmin/Website_Tutorial/blob/master/index.html">here</a>. 
               The code has comments to explain what each portion of code is doing.</p>
